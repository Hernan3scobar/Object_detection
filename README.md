# Object_detection

I utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection to Accurately Classify images

In this project, I implemented a real-time object detection system using YOLO, specifically the YOLOv8 variant, for its balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. YOLO is a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed for fast and accurate object detection. It is known for its efficiency in detecting and classifying multiple objects within a single image by predicting bounding boxes and class labels in one forward pass through the network. This allows for high-speed processing, making it suitable for real-time applications.

The task of this implementation was to classify whether individuals are wearing masks or not.
